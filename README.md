# AI-for-Identifying-Cybersecurity-Threats
A capstone project built to classify network traffic as benign or malicious using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Python. Achieved high detection accuracy using the CICIDS2017 dataset, feature selection (PCA, SelectKBest), and deep learning techniques.

## 👥 Team

- **Sujal G S** 
- Lakshminarayanan P S  
- Prakul K Gowda  
- Vagish N Kora

## 🚀 Highlights

- 90%+ accuracy using ANN
- Feature selection using SelectKBest & PCA
- Model benchmarking with SVM and Decision Trees
- Data preprocessing with normalization, label encoding, and imputation
- Built using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy

## 📂 Dataset

Used [CICIDS2017 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) for real-world network traffic scenarios.

## 📈 Metrics

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix and comparison bar charts
